                    Hey, Jude, don't be afraid
                    You were made to go out and get her
                    The minute you let her under your skin
                    Then you begin to make it better
                    And anytime you feel the pain, Hey, Jude, refrain
                    Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
                    For well you know that it's a fool
                    Who plays it cool
                    By making his world a little colder

                    You have found her, now go and get her
                    Remember to let her into your heart
                    Then you can start to make it better
                    So let it out and let it in, Hey, Jude, begin
                    You're waiting for someone to perform with
                    And don't you know that it's just you, Hey, Jude, you'll do
                    The movement you need is on your shoulder
                    Nah,nah,nah,nah,nah,nah,nah,nah,nah, Hey, Jude, don't make it bad
                    Take a sad song and make it better
                    Remember to let her under your skin
                    Then you'll begin to make it better, better, better, better, better... oh!`
